This script does a 'git pull -p' on all subdirectories.
It currently assumes that you are using HTTP Basic Authentication with git.
Furthermore it assumes that you do not need to enter your username.
To achieve that use a git repository URL like https://username@repository_path

The script asks for your password once and enters the password for every git repo it pushes for you.
